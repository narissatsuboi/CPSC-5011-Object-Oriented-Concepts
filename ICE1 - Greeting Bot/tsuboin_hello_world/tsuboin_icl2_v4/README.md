# Assigment
We're going to start developing some muscle memory in the usage of Github and IntelliJ (and/or confirm that you know how this all works.)

# Objectives
1. Make your own copy of the class repo on Github.
2. Get some code from that copy.
3. Modify that code.
4. Push the code to your repo.
5. Submit the code in Canvas as homework.

# Instructions
1. Make a fork of the `cpsc-5011-fall-2021-projects` repo [here](https://github.com/stephen-riley/cpsc-5011-fall-2021-projects).
2. Download the fork to your computer.  I recommend using the [Github desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) to make things easier if you're not familiar with Github on the command line.
3. Copy the `week_01/hello_world` directory to `week_01/<email name>_hellow_world`.
4. Modify the code in your new directory as follows:
   1. Change the package name from `com.sriley` to `com.(your name)`.  This will involve renaming a directory, too!
   2. Change the output text to say "hello, world" in some other language.
5. Push your code back into your fork.
6. Verify you can see it in Github.com.
7. Issue a "pull request" to submit your code to the main repo.
8. Export your code as a `.zip` for submission in Canvas.
9. Submit it in Canvas.

# Languages
See http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human for 77 different ways of saying "hello, world".
